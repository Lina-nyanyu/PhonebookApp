Description Of The Project :
This PhoneBook program is a simple Java application that allows users to manage their contacts. It provides functionalities to add, search, update, delete, display, and sort contacts.
Key Features:
Contact Management: Users can add new contacts by entering a name and phone number.
Search Functionality: Users can search for a contact by name, and the program will display the contact's details if found.
Update and Delete: Users can update a contact's phone number or delete a contact from the phone book.
Display and Sort: The program can display all contacts and sort them alphabetically by name.
User Interaction: It uses a menu-driven interface, allowing users to choose actions easily.

Data Structure We used:
The program uses an ArrayList to store the contacts, which allows for dynamic resizing as contacts are added or removed. This makes it efficient for managing a variable number of contacts.
Overall, this phone book application is a practical tool for organizing and accessing contact information.
